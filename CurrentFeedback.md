Danny and Manuel, I think that you have a good project idea, but I think that I want you to focus it a bit. It's still quite broad, so thinking about one specific (or maybe two specific) plasma model(s) that you will address will be important for this coming week. Also, I am hoping to see more how computational modeling will be featured in your project as, right now, it seems like you are focused on the analytical, so I'm hoping to see more of the comptuational in the later projects updates.
