## HW12; Score: 16/20

Danny and Manuel, thanks for the poster "wireframe"; it's really helpful. I do think you might be realying too much on the mathematics in the poster. You will also need to inform people what these waves are and why we should care about them, so make sure to make space for that and a conceptual diagram of the waves. You will also need to motivate these graphs in your notebook. I'm not precisely sure why I should care about the phase velocity for these waves because you haven't yet explained why that's the important thing to care about. So make sure that you are doing that because otherwise you are just making plots of things you can plot and not really doing the physics!
