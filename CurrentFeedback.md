Danny and Manuel, I think you have narrowed your project to something sensible, which is good. It takes a while to do that, but I think you have something now that is the right scale for you to work on. I looked at your code, which appears to try to model the phase veloicty of these plasma waves...but I need a lot more detail to understand what you are doing and why. I think analyzing these waves and showing people what they are and what their properties are is a really cool idea, but I'm concerned that you haven't though completely thorugh the mathematical analysis you intend to do and how it connects to the physics. You do mention that in your self reflection, which I appreciated.
