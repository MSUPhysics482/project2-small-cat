Danny and Manuel, I think that I have a pretty good sense of what you are planning, but I think you might be biting off more than what you think. MHD is a pretty broad topic and can get pretty dense, pretty quickly. I think you want to narrow to a specific model and not trying to solve the general problem. So maybe the thing to do is to focus on a canonical plasma problem and model it numerically in addition to doing something analytically with it. So I'd recommend looking in a few of the basic results of plasma work. I'm also glad that you are sharing the workload well. Good job.
