Danny and Manuel, you are free to choose the most interesting story to tell your classmates about with regard to these waves. It's important that the story be coherent and grounded in the appropriate physics, but beyond that it's up to you. Each of the aspects you discussed in your writeup is reaonasble, but you probably want some number of them to tell an interesting story. So I think you are on the right track here, but you should trust that you both know what to do and how to do it.
