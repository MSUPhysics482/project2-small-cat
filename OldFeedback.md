Fellas, I think you have a very ambitious project here. It's probably a bit too ambitious for the scale of the project here. I think there's a lot you can do just with plasma physics and employing some basic plasma models. I would strongly suggest narrowing the scope of your project and, perhaps, consider focusing specifically on the physics of the plasma and what you can model computationally.
