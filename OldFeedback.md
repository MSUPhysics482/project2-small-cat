Danny and Manuel, I think you have narrowed your project to something sensible, which is good. It takes a while to do that, but I think you have something now that is the right scale for you to work on. I looked at your code, which appears to try to model the phase veloicty of these plasma waves...but I need a lot more detail to understand what you are doing and why. I think analyzing these waves and showing people what they are and what their properties are is a really cool idea, but I'm concerned that you haven't though completely thorugh the mathematical analysis you intend to do and how it connects to the physics. You do mention that in your self reflection, which I appreciated.

Danny and Manuel, I think that I have a pretty good sense of what you are planning, but I think you might be biting off more than what you think. MHD is a pretty broad topic and can get pretty dense, pretty quickly. I think you want to narrow to a specific model and not trying to solve the general problem. So maybe the thing to do is to focus on a canonical plasma problem and model it numerically in addition to doing something analytically with it. So I'd recommend looking in a few of the basic results of plasma work. I'm also glad that you are sharing the workload well. Good job.

Danny and Manuel, I think that you have a good project idea, but I think that I want you to focus it a bit. It's still quite broad, so thinking about one specific (or maybe two specific) plasma model(s) that you will address will be important for this coming week. Also, I am hoping to see more how computational modeling will be featured in your project as, right now, it seems like you are focused on the analytical, so I'm hoping to see more of the comptuational in the later projects updates.

Fellas, I think you have a very ambitious project here. It's probably a bit too ambitious for the scale of the project here. I think there's a lot you can do just with plasma physics and employing some basic plasma models. I would strongly suggest narrowing the scope of your project and, perhaps, consider focusing specifically on the physics of the plasma and what you can model computationally.
